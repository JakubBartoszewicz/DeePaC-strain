# DeePaC-strain

DeePaC-strain is a plugin for DeePaC (see below) shipping built-in models for predicting pathogenic potentials of novel strains of known bacterial species.

# DeePaC

DeePaC is a python package and a CLI tool for predicting labels (e.g. pathogenic potentials) from short DNA sequences (e.g. Illumina 
reads) with interpretable reverse-complement neural networks. For details, see our preprint on bioRxiv: 
<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/535286v3> and the paper in *Bioinformatics*: <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz541>.
For details regarding the interpretability functionalities of DeePaC, see the preprint here: <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.925354v2>

Documentation can be found here:

## Installation

### Recommended: set up an environment

We recomment setting up an isolated `conda` environment:
```
conda create -n my_env python=3.6
conda activate my_env
```

or, alternatively, a `virtualenv`:
```
virtualenv --system-site-packages my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```


### With conda (recommended)
 [![install with bioconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-bioconda-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/deepac/README.html)
 
You can install DeePaC-strain with `bioconda`. Set up the [bioconda channel](
<https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html#set-up-channels>) first, and then:
```
conda install deepacstrain
```

DeePaC will be installed automatically.

### With pip

You can also install DeePaC-strain with `pip`:
```
pip install deepacstrain
```
Note: TensorFlow 2.0 is not yet supported.

### GPU support

To use GPUs, you need to install the GPU version of TensorFlow. In conda, install tensorflow-gpu from the `defaults` channel before deepac:
```
conda remove tensorflow
conda install -c defaults tensorflow-gpu=1.15 
conda install deepacstrain
```
DeePaC will be installed automatically. Note: TensorFlow 2.0 is not yet supported.

If you're using `pip`, you need to install CUDA and CuDNN first (see TensorFlow installation guide for details). Then
you can do the same as above:
```
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15
```

## Usage
DeePaC-strain may be used exactly as the base version of DeePaC. To use the plugin, substitute the `deepac` command for `deepac-strain`.
Visit <https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics/DeePaC> for a DeePaC readme describing basic usage.

For example, you can use the following commands:
```
# See help
deepac-strain --help

# Run quick tests (eg. on CPUs)
deepac-strain test -q
# Full tests on a GPU
deepac-strain test -a -g 1

# Predict using a rapid CNN (trained on VHDB data) using a GPU
deepac-strain predict -r -g 1 input.fasta
# Predict using a sensitive LSTM (trained on VHDB data) using a GPU
deepac-strain predict -s -g 1 input.fasta
```

## Supplementary data and scripts
In the main DeePaC repository (<https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics/DeePaC>) you can find the R scripts and data files used in the papers for dataset preprocessing and benchmarking.
